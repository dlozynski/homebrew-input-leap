  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      You will need to access the InputLeap.app directly from:
        #{opt_prefix}/InputLeap.app

      Run this at least once to properly register accessibility
      permissions before using the CLI tools.

      If your run into an accessibility permissions loop, try
      running:
        tccutil reset Accessibility input-leap

      This will reset your accessibility permissions; running the app
      again should then correctly grant it.

      The command-line binaries input-leapc (client) and input-leaps
      (server) have been linked and should be available from your
      PATH.

      Man pages have also been installed, and you will be able to find
      config file examples in:
        #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/doc/input-leap
    EOS

  test do
    # Test not implemented for the time being as we're likely not
    # sending this to homebrew-core. Official formula will likely be
    # a cask, similar to Barrier.
